Privoxy is a wonderful project to which I'm in debt to its contributers. My project simply makes managing Privoxy's settings on macOS a bit easier. It also incorperates block lists from the Block List Project.

When stable I plan on using what has been done here and building the privoxy-pilot-ChromeOS project.
