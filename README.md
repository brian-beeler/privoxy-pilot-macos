A bash script and set of templates to better manage Privoxy on macOS.

Privoxy is a wonderful project to which I'm in debt to its contributers. My project simply makes managing Privoxy's settings on macOS a bit easier. Features include:

- status panel with copius status details and past events
- detailed logging of events
- ability to easily switch between different groups of filters from a single command line
- built to work with Privoxy installations done with brew
- incorperates block lists from the Block List Project.

When stable I plan on using what has been done here and building the privoxy-pilot-ChromeOS project.
